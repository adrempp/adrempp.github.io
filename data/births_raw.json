His other novels \"Mirza\", \"Fifty Three Persons\" and \"Gilemard\" are mentioned in Iranian high-school textbooks. He did return to Tehran after the revolution but did not stay too long and decided to head back to Germany.

He was a founding member of the communist Tudeh Party of Iran in the 1940s and – following the 1953 coup against Premier Mohammad Mossadegh – spent the rest of his life in exile in East Germany, first during the Pahlavi regime, then returning to Germany once more following the 1979 revolution. <i>Cheshm'hā'yash</i>, which was published in Iran in 1952 and was subsequently banned, is considered his finest novel. Alavi was also a very close friend of Iran's famous writer Sadegh Hedayat; these two created a literary group\nwhen they were residing in Paris called \"sab'e group\". Although <i>Her Eyes</i> is considered his masterpiece, Alavi also wrote many other books, such as the novel \"<i>Chamedan\"</i> (suitcase) which was written under the influence of Freudian psychology. His other novels \"<i>Mirza\",</i> \"<i>Fifty Three Persons\"</i> and \"<i>Gilemard\"</i> are mentioned in Iranian high-school textbooks.
