It is used recreationally and competitively for throwing and catching, as in flying disc games. The shape of the disc is an airfoil in cross-section which allows it to fly by reducing the drag and increasing lift as it moves through the air, compared to a flat plate. Spinning the disc imparts a stabilizing gyroscopic force, allowing it to be both aimed with accuracy and thrown for distance.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Frisbee"}],"year":1920},{"text":"Frances Bay, Canadian-American actress (died 2011)","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Frances_Bay","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Frances Bay</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q292446","titles":{"canonical":"Frances_Bay","normalized":"Frances Bay","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Frances Bay</span>"},"pageid":3434494,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3c/Frances_bay.jpg","width":278,"height":351},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3c/Frances_bay.jpg","width":278,"height":351},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1323753547","tid":"65efbff6-c882-11f0-bc2f-dbb12095f99c","timestamp":"2025-11-23T15:38:03Z","description":"American actress (1919–2011)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Bay","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Bay?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Bay?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Frances_Bay"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Bay","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Frances_Bay","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Bay?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Frances_Bay"}},"extract":"Frances Evelyn Bay was a Canadian and American character actress and comedian.
