In 1988, she released her third album, Lucinda Williams, to widespread critical acclaim. Regarded as \"an Americana classic\", the album also featured \"Passionate Kisses\", a song later recorded by Mary Chapin Carpenter for her 1992 album Come On Come On, which garnered Williams her first Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1994.

The only child of actor DeWolf Hopper and actress and Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper, he appeared in more than 80 feature films in the 1930s and 1940s. After serving in the United States Navy during World War II, he left acting, but was persuaded by director William Wellman in the 1950s to resume his film career. He’s perhaps best known for his portrayal of private detective Paul Drake in the CBS television series <i>Perry Mason</i>.</p>","normalizedtitle":"William Hopper"}],"year":1915},{"text":"Dürrüşehvar Sultan, Imperial Princess of the Ottoman Empire (died 2006)","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Dürrüşehvar_Sultan","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Dürrüşehvar Sultan</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q4381410","titles":{"canonical":"Dürrüşehvar_Sultan","normalized":"Dürrüşehvar Sultan","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Dürrüşehvar Sultan</span>"},"pageid":4012060,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Cecil_Beaton_Photographs-_Political_and_Military_Personalities%3B_Durri_Shehvar%2C_Princess_IB783.jpg/330px-Cecil_Beaton_Photographs-_Political_and_Military_Personalities%3B_Durri_Shehvar%2C_Princess_IB783.jpg","width":320,"height":332},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Cecil_Beaton_Photographs-_Political_and_Military_Personalities%3B_Durri_Shehvar%2C_Princess_IB783.jpg","width":3508,"height":3644},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1334843319","tid":"d367caf5-fa44-11f0-81c6-fd37614c67e3","timestamp":"2026-01-25T23:23:16Z","description":"Ottoman princess (1914–2006)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%BCrr%C3%BC%C5%9Fehvar_Sultan","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%BCrr%C3%BC%C5%9Fehvar_Sultan?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%BCrr%C3%BC%C5%9Fehvar_Sultan?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:D%C3%BCrr%C3%BC%C5%9Fehvar_Sultan"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%BCrr%C3%BC%C5%9Fehvar_Sultan","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/D%C3%BCrr%C3%BC%C5%9Fehvar_Sultan","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%BCrr%C3%BC%C5%9Fehvar_Sultan?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:D%C3%BCrr%C3%BC%C5%9Fehvar_Sultan"}},"extract":"Hatice Hayriye Ayşe Dürrüşehvar Sultan, after marriage named Durru Shehvar Durdana Begum Sahiba, Princess of Berar; was an Ottoman princess by birth and Hyderabad princess by marriage.
