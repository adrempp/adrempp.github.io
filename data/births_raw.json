Cook was a student of Antonín Dvořák. In 1919 he took his New York Syncopated Orchestra to England for a command performance for King George V of the United Kingdom, and tour. Cook is probably best known for his popular songs and landmark Broadway musicals, featuring African-American creators, producers, and casts, such as <i>Clorindy, or The Origin of the Cake Walk</i> (1898) and <i>In Dahomey</i> (1903). The latter toured for four years, including in the United Kingdom and United States.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Will Marion Cook"}],"year":1869},{"text":"Wilhelm II, German Emperor during World War I (died 1941)","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Wilhelm_II","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Wilhelm II</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2677","titles":{"canonical":"Wilhelm_II","normalized":"Wilhelm II","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Wilhelm II</span>"},"pageid":50450,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Kaiser_Wilhelm_II_of_Germany_-_1902_%28cropped%29.jpg/330px-Kaiser_Wilhelm_II_of_Germany_-_1902_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":320,"height":441},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Kaiser_Wilhelm_II_of_Germany_-_1902_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":3743,"height":5154},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1332384502","tid":"b5f3166a-ef04-11f0-94a4-338173c05610","timestamp":"2026-01-11T15:46:36Z","description":"German Emperor from 1888 to 1918","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wilhelm_II"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Wilhelm_II","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wilhelm_II"}},"extract":"Wilhelm II was the last German Emperor and King of Prussia from 1888 until his abdication in 1918.
