This was based on the Tyler Precedent set in 1841 when John Tyler became the first vice president to take over for a deceased president following the death of William Henry Harrison.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Vice President of the United States"}],"year":1860},{"text":"Mikimoto Kōkichi, Japanese businessman (died 1954)","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Kokichi_Mikimoto","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Kokichi Mikimoto</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q956283","titles":{"canonical":"Kokichi_Mikimoto","normalized":"Kokichi Mikimoto","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Kokichi Mikimoto</span>"},"pageid":66809,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/MIKIMOTO_Kokichi.jpg/330px-MIKIMOTO_Kokichi.jpg","width":320,"height":463},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/MIKIMOTO_Kokichi.jpg","width":1024,"height":1480},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1297147144","tid":"667806fc-50f0-11f0-ae89-42a716c44028","timestamp":"2025-06-24T11:43:09Z","description":"Japanese entrepreneur (1858–1954)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokichi_Mikimoto","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokichi_Mikimoto?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokichi_Mikimoto?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kokichi_Mikimoto"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokichi_Mikimoto","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Kokichi_Mikimoto","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokichi_Mikimoto?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kokichi_Mikimoto"}},"extract":"Kokichi Mikimoto  was a Japanese entrepreneur who is credited with creating the first cultured pearl and subsequently starting the cultured pearl industry with the establishment of his luxury pearl company Mikimoto.","extract_html":"<p><b>Kokichi Mikimoto</b><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"> </span> was a Japanese entrepreneur who is credited with creating the first cultured pearl and subsequently starting the cultured pearl industry with the establishment of his luxury pearl company Mikimoto.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Kokichi Mikimoto"}],"year":1858},{"text":"John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher, English admiral (died 1920)","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"John_Fisher,_1st_Baron_Fisher","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q334999","titles":{"canonical":"John_Fisher,_1st_Baron_Fisher","normalized":"John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher</span>"},"pageid":376503,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/John_Arbuthnot_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher_by_Sir_Hubert_von_Herkomer.jpg/330px-John_Arbuthnot_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher_by_Sir_Hubert_von_Herkomer.jpg","width":320,"height":469},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/John_Arbuthnot_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher_by_Sir_Hubert_von_Herkomer.jpg","width":2400,"height":3516},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1334730358","tid":"b98ba0b4-f9ce-11f0-80d2-81546343d0a2","timestamp":"2026-01-25T09:17:52Z","description":"Royal Navy officer (1841–1920)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:John_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/John_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:John_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher"}},"extract":"Admiral of the Fleet John Arbuthnot Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher,, commonly known as Jacky or Jackie Fisher, was a Royal Navy officer.
