Walcott was a member of the \"three W's\", the other two being Everton Weekes and Frank Worrell: all were very successful batsmen from Barbados, born within a short distance of each other in Bridgetown, Barbados in a period of 18 months from August 1924 to January 1926; all made their Test cricket debut against England in 1948. \nIn the mid-1950s, Walcott was arguably the best batsman in the world. He was the manager of the West Indian squads which won the 1975 Cricket World Cup and the 1979 Cricket World Cup. In later life, he had an active career as a cricket administrator, and was the first non-English and non-white chairman of the International Cricket Council.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Clyde Walcott"}],"year":1926},{"text":"Gunnar Birkerts, Latvian-American architect (died 2017)","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Gunnar_Birkerts","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Gunnar Birkerts</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1554720","titles":{"canonical":"Gunnar_Birkerts","normalized":"Gunnar Birkerts","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Gunnar Birkerts</span>"},"pageid":2621138,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Gunnar_Birkerts%2C_Associate_Professor_of_Architecture_-_HS13349.jpg/330px-Gunnar_Birkerts%2C_Associate_Professor_of_Architecture_-_HS13349.jpg","width":320,"height":403},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Gunnar_Birkerts%2C_Associate_Professor_of_Architecture_-_HS13349.jpg","width":4421,"height":5570},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1314612281","tid":"212d6490-9f78-11f0-bcd4-3eef9a1f9385","timestamp":"2025-10-02T10:11:15Z","description":"American architect","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Birkerts","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Birkerts?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Birkerts?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gunnar_Birkerts"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Birkerts","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Gunnar_Birkerts","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Birkerts?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gunnar_Birkerts"}},"extract":"Gunnar Birkerts was a Latvian American architect who, for the most of his career, was based in the metropolitan area of Detroit, Michigan.","extract_html":"<p><b>Gunnar Birkerts</b> was a Latvian American architect who, for the most of his career, was based in the metropolitan area of Detroit, Michigan.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Gunnar Birkerts"}],"year":1925},{"text":"Robert Cormier, American author and journalist (died 2000)","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Robert_Cormier","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Robert Cormier</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q432575","titles":{"canonical":"Robert_Cormier","normalized":"Robert Cormier","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Robert Cormier</span>"},"pageid":850720,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f5/Cormier_Robert.jpg","width":140,"height":180},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f5/Cormier_Robert.jpg","width":140,"height":180},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1319498597","tid":"b3f6f977-b54a-11f0-a5b1-649da22ee868","timestamp":"2025-10-30T04:41:30Z","description":"American writer and journalist (1925–2000)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cormier","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cormier?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cormier?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Robert_Cormier"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cormier","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Robert_Cormier","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cormier?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Robert_Cormier"}},"extract":"Robert Edmund Cormier was an American writer and journalist, known for his deeply pessimistic novels, many of which were written for young adults.
