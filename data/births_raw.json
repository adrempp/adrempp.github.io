He earlier served as the 25th United States secretary of the treasury from 1861 to 1864, during the American Civil War in the Abraham Lincoln administration. Chase also served as the 23rd governor of Ohio from 1856 to 1860, and represented Ohio in the United States Senate from 1849 to 1855 and again in 1861. Chase is therefore one of the few American politicians who have held constitutional office in all three branches of the federal government, in addition to serving in the highest state-level office.
