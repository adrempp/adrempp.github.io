From adolescence on, he dedicated his life to the promotion of liberty, political independence for Cuba, and intellectual independence for all Spanish Americans; his death was used as a cry for Cuban independence from Spain by both the Cuban revolutionaries and those Cubans previously reluctant to start a revolt.</p>","normalizedtitle":"José Martí"}],"year":1853},{"text":"Vladimir Solovyov, Russian philosopher, poet, and critic (died 1900)","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Vladimir_Solovyov_(philosopher)","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q282280","titles":{"canonical":"Vladimir_Solovyov_(philosopher)","normalized":"Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)</span>"},"pageid":829763,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/VS_Solovyov.jpg/330px-VS_Solovyov.jpg","width":330,"height":438},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/VS_Solovyov.jpg","width":828,"height":1100},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1322986536","tid":"60d6ee8f-c4dd-11f0-9792-9135559ab69d","timestamp":"2025-11-19T00:19:14Z","description":"Russian philosopher and Christian mystic (1853–1900)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Solovyov_(philosopher)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Solovyov_(philosopher)?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Solovyov_(philosopher)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vladimir_Solovyov_(philosopher)"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Solovyov_(philosopher)","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Vladimir_Solovyov_(philosopher)","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Solovyov_(philosopher)?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vladimir_Solovyov_(philosopher)"}},"extract":"Vladimir Sergeyevich Solovyov was a Russian philosopher, theologian, poet, pamphleteer, and literary critic, who played a significant role in the development of Russian philosophy and poetry at the end of the 19th century and in the spiritual renaissance of the early 20th century.","extract_html":"<p><b>Vladimir Sergeyevich Solovyov</b> was a Russian philosopher, theologian, poet, pamphleteer, and literary critic, who played a significant role in the development of Russian philosophy and poetry at the end of the 19th century and in the spiritual renaissance of the early 20th century.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)"}],"year":1853},{"text":"Charles George Gordon, English general and politician (died 1885)","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Charles_George_Gordon","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Charles George Gordon</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q310035","titles":{"canonical":"Charles_George_Gordon","normalized":"Charles George Gordon","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Charles George Gordon</span>"},"pageid":210968,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Charles_George_Gordon_by_Freres.jpg","width":279,"height":417},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Charles_George_Gordon_by_Freres.jpg","width":279,"height":417},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1332986123","tid":"c3322f03-f1ac-11f0-9cf7-9200d260ecbc","timestamp":"2026-01-15T00:54:36Z","description":"British general (1833–1885)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_George_Gordon","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_George_Gordon?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_George_Gordon?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Charles_George_Gordon"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_George_Gordon","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Charles_George_Gordon","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_George_Gordon?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Charles_George_Gordon"}},"extract":"Major General  Charles George Gordon CB, also known as Chinese Gordon, Gordon Pasha, Gordon of Khartoum and General Gordon, was a British Army officer and administrator.
