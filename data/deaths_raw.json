After a couple of years as an imam in İskilip in 1893 he went to Istanbul to continue his education, first at a medrese and from 1902 at Darü'l-fünun Faculty of Divinity. He graduated in 1903 and took a job teaching as Ders-i Amm (Ulama), at the madrasah in the Fatih Mosque, Istanbul. He was later arrested and jailed several times, but freed. He and Mustafa Sabri were the founding members of <i>Cemiyet-i Müderrisin.</i> They were fiercely against the national government in Ankara which led the Turks to the Turkish War of Independence. His father was a Turk from the Akkoyunlu Bayındır tribe, while his mother was an Arab originally from Hijaz.</p>","normalizedtitle":"İskilipli Mehmed Atıf Hoca"}],"year":1926},{"text":"Franz Reichelt, French tailor and inventor (born 1878)","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Franz_Reichelt","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Franz Reichelt</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q112070","titles":{"canonical":"Franz_Reichelt","normalized":"Franz Reichelt","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Franz Reichelt</span>"},"pageid":5065635,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Franz_Reichelt_%28high_res%29.jpg/330px-Franz_Reichelt_%28high_res%29.jpg","width":330,"height":367},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Franz_Reichelt_%28high_res%29.jpg","width":2338,"height":2600},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1333460177","tid":"e865ad5e-f3f5-11f0-961c-b7e69706dfd3","timestamp":"2026-01-17T22:43:14Z","description":"French parachuting pioneer (1878–1912)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Reichelt","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Reichelt?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Reichelt?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Franz_Reichelt"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Reichelt","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Franz_Reichelt","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Reichelt?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Franz_Reichelt"}},"extract":"Franz Reichelt, also known as Frantz Reichelt or François Reichelt, was an Austro-Hungarian-born French tailor, inventor and parachuting pioneer, now sometimes referred to as the Flying Tailor.

Ceolnoth's later years in office were marked by more Viking raids and a decline in monastic life in his archbishopric.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Ceolnoth"},{"type":"standard","title":"Diocese_of_Canterbury","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Diocese of Canterbury</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2066595","titles":{"canonical":"Diocese_of_Canterbury","normalized":"Diocese of Canterbury","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Diocese of Canterbury</span>"},"pageid":1916875,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_arms.svg/330px-Archbishop_of_Canterbury_arms.svg.png","width":330,"height":443},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_arms.svg/960px-Archbishop_of_Canterbury_arms.svg.png","width":503,"height":676},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1324459937","tid":"1af7e4c8-cbc3-11f0-aea4-60b56fdc8d75","timestamp":"2025-11-27T18:58:48Z","description":"Diocese of the Church of England","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":51.27972222,"lon":1.08333333},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Canterbury","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Canterbury?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Canterbury?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Diocese_of_Canterbury"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Canterbury","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Diocese_of_Canterbury","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Canterbury?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Diocese_of_Canterbury"}},"extract":"The Diocese of Canterbury is a Church of England diocese covering eastern Kent which was founded by St Augustine of Canterbury in 597.
