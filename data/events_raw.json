It completes an orbit in relation to Earth and the Sun (synodically) every 29.5 days. The Moon and Earth are bound by gravitational attraction, which is stronger on the sides facing each other. The resulting tidal forces are the main driver of Earth's tides, and have pulled the Moon to always face Earth with the same near side.

It is one of the two major Indian political parties alongside the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the oldest party in India. Founded on 28 December 1885, it was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa. From the late 19th century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement. The Congress was one of the parties who led India to independence from the United Kingdom, and significantly influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Indian National Congress"},{"type":"standard","title":"Purna_Swaraj","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Purna Swaraj</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q2723918","titles":{"canonical":"Purna_Swaraj","normalized":"Purna Swaraj","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Purna Swaraj</span>"},"pageid":4332530,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/The_Indian_National_Congress_moves_toward_independence.jpg/330px-The_Indian_National_Congress_moves_toward_independence.jpg","width":320,"height":243},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/The_Indian_National_Congress_moves_toward_independence.jpg","width":1024,"height":776},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1334875451","tid":"59483dcd-fa66-11f0-b711-3fb369974b0b","timestamp":"2026-01-26T03:23:14Z","description":"Proclamation of Indian independence from the British Empire published on 26 Jan. 1930","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purna_Swaraj","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purna_Swaraj?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purna_Swaraj?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Purna_Swaraj"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purna_Swaraj","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Purna_Swaraj","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purna_Swaraj?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Purna_Swaraj"}},"extract":"The Declaration of Purna Swaraj or Declaration of the Independence of India was a resolution which was passed by the Indian National Congress in 1930 because of the dissatisfaction among the Indian masses regarding the British offer of Dominion status to India.

It consisted of two Royal Navy vessels, three storeships and six convict transports under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip. On 13 May 1787, the ships, with over 1,400 convicts, marines, sailors, colonial officials and free settlers onboard, left Portsmouth and travelled over 24,000 kilometres and over 250 days before arriving in Botany Bay on 18 January 1788. Governor Arthur Phillip rejected Botany Bay choosing instead Port Jackson, to the north, as the site for the new colony; they arrived there on 26 January 1788, establishing the colony of New South Wales, as a penal colony which would become the first British settlement in Australia.</p>","normalizedtitle":"First Fleet"},{"type":"standard","title":"Arthur_Phillip","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Arthur Phillip</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q311548","titles":{"canonical":"Arthur_Phillip","normalized":"Arthur Phillip","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Arthur Phillip</span>"},"pageid":2563,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Arthur_Phillip_-_Wheatley_ML124_%28cropped%29.jpg/330px-Arthur_Phillip_-_Wheatley_ML124_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":320,"height":377},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Arthur_Phillip_-_Wheatley_ML124_%28cropped%29.jpg","width":1307,"height":1538},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1327924472","tid":"9adfe2aa-dacd-11f0-8d45-d2dee708c5b7","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:21:45Z","description":"Royal Navy Admiral and colonial administrator (1738–1814)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Phillip","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Phillip?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Phillip?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Arthur_Phillip"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Phillip","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Arthur_Phillip","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Phillip?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Arthur_Phillip"}},"extract":"Arthur Phillip was a British Royal Navy officer who served as the first governor of the Colony of New South Wales.","extract_html":"<p><b>Arthur Phillip</b> was a British Royal Navy officer who served as the first governor of the Colony of New South Wales.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Arthur Phillip"},{"type":"standard","title":"Port_Jackson","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Port Jackson</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q54504","titles":{"canonical":"Port_Jackson","normalized":"Port Jackson","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Port Jackson</span>"},"pageid":297385,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Sydney%28from_air%29_V2.jpg/330px-Sydney%28from_air%29_V2.jpg","width":320,"height":189},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Sydney%28from_air%29_V2.jpg","width":1272,"height":750},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1332483688","tid":"b8d12786-ef63-11f0-9dbc-b54c79cbd3a5","timestamp":"2026-01-12T03:06:43Z","description":"Body of water in Sydney, Australia","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":-33.85833333,"lon":151.23333333},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Jackson","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Jackson?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Jackson?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Port_Jackson"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Jackson","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Port_Jackson","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Jackson?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Port_Jackson"}},"extract":"Port Jackson, commonly known as Sydney Harbour, is a natural harbour on the east coast of Australia, around which Sydney was built.
