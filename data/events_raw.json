The fighting spilled into the Laotian and Cambodian Civil Wars, which ended with all three countries becoming communist in 1975.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Vietnam War"},{"type":"standard","title":"Viet_Cong","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Viet Cong</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q174423","titles":{"canonical":"Viet_Cong","normalized":"Viet Cong","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Viet Cong</span>"},"pageid":68286,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Achievement_of_the_Viet_Cong_on_a_diplom_of_the_Viet_Cong%2C_1966.jpg/330px-Achievement_of_the_Viet_Cong_on_a_diplom_of_the_Viet_Cong%2C_1966.jpg","width":330,"height":149},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Achievement_of_the_Viet_Cong_on_a_diplom_of_the_Viet_Cong%2C_1966.jpg","width":426,"height":192},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1332054769","tid":"7ea62de4-ed7d-11f0-8011-d160f9e0f9f6","timestamp":"2026-01-09T17:06:10Z","description":"Revolutionary organization active in South Vietnam and Cambodia from 1960 to 1977","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Viet_Cong"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Viet_Cong","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Viet_Cong"}},"extract":"The Viet Cong (VC) was an epithet and umbrella term to refer to the communist-led armed movement and united front organization in South Vietnam.
