The Fujita scale, named for the meteorologist Ted Fujita, was replaced with the Enhanced Fujita scale (EF-Scale) in the United States in February 2007. In April 2013, Canada adopted the EF-Scale over the Fujita scale along with 31 \"Specific Damage Indicators\" used by Environment Canada (EC) in their ratings.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Fujita scale"},{"type":"standard","title":"Enhanced_Fujita_scale","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Enhanced Fujita scale</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q429050","titles":{"canonical":"Enhanced_Fujita_scale","normalized":"Enhanced Fujita scale","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Enhanced Fujita scale</span>"},"pageid":3724479,"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1334000646","tid":"81e2c823-f65d-11f0-a789-cb2f8e92f888","timestamp":"2026-01-21T00:09:52Z","description":"Tornado intensity rating scale","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_scale","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_scale?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_scale?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Enhanced_Fujita_scale"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_scale","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Enhanced_Fujita_scale","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_scale?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Enhanced_Fujita_scale"}},"extract":"The Enhanced Fujita scale is a scale that rates tornado intensity based on the severity of the damage a tornado causes.
