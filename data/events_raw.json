The two events that receive the most media coverage are the Primetime Emmy Awards and the Daytime Emmy Awards, which recognize outstanding work in American primetime and daytime entertainment programming, respectively. Other notable American national Emmy events include the Children's &amp; Family Emmy Awards for children's and family-oriented television programming, the Sports Emmy Awards for sports programming, News and Documentary Emmy Awards for news and documentary shows, and the Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards and the Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards for technological and engineering achievements. <span class=\"mw-selflink-fragment\">Regional Emmy Awards</span> are also presented throughout the country at various times through the year, recognizing excellence in local television. In addition, the International Emmy Awards honor excellence in TV programming produced and initially aired outside the United States.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Emmy Awards"},{"type":"standard","title":"Hollywood_Athletic_Club","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Hollywood Athletic Club</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q5882585","titles":{"canonical":"Hollywood_Athletic_Club","normalized":"Hollywood Athletic Club","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Hollywood Athletic Club</span>"},"pageid":26354949,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/HollywoodAthleticClub_Dec2006.jpg/330px-HollywoodAthleticClub_Dec2006.jpg","width":320,"height":240},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/HollywoodAthleticClub_Dec2006.jpg","width":1600,"height":1200},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1308943181","tid":"82121667-870e-11f0-815f-f62743e0e202","timestamp":"2025-09-01T08:34:43Z","coordinates":{"lat":34.098157,"lon":-118.331961},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Athletic_Club","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Athletic_Club?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Athletic_Club?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hollywood_Athletic_Club"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Athletic_Club","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Hollywood_Athletic_Club","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Athletic_Club?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hollywood_Athletic_Club"}},"extract":"The Hollywood Athletic Club is an office building and event space in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles.","extract_html":"<p>The <b>Hollywood Athletic Club</b> is an office building and event space in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Hollywood Athletic Club"}],"year":1949},{"text":"Thomas Goldsmith Jr. files a patent for a \"Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device\", the first ever electronic game.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"Thomas_T._Goldsmith_Jr.","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Thomas T.

The first Winter Olympic Games, the 1924 Winter Olympics, were held in Chamonix, France. The modern Olympic Games were inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from 776 BCE to 394 CE. The Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) 1,500 years later in 1894, leading to the first modern Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.\nThe original five Winter Olympic Sports were bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, Nordic skiing, and skating. The Games were held every four years from 1924 to 1936, interrupted in 1940 and 1944 by World War II, and resumed in 1948. Until 1992, the Summer Olympic Games and the Winter Olympic Games were held in the same year. A decision to change this was made in 1986, when during the 91st International Olympic Committee session, IOC members decided to alternate the Summer Olympic Games and the Winter Olympic Games on separate four-year cycles in even-numbered years.

The first Winter Olympic Games, the 1924 Winter Olympics, were held in Chamonix, France. The modern Olympic Games were inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from 776 BCE to 394 CE. The Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) 1,500 years later in 1894, leading to the first modern Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.\nThe original five Winter Olympic Sports were bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, Nordic skiing, and skating. The Games were held every four years from 1924 to 1936, interrupted in 1940 and 1944 by World War II, and resumed in 1948.
