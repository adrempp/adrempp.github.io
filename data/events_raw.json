The sprawling Malacañang Palace complex includes numerous mansions and office buildings designed and built largely in the bahay na bato and neoclassical styles. Among the presidents of the present Fifth Republic, only Gloria Macapagal Arroyo actually lived in the main palace as both her office and her residence, with all others residing in nearby properties that form part of the larger palace complex. The palace has been seized several times as a result of protests starting with the People Power Revolution of 1986, the 1989 coup attempt, the 2001 Manila riots, and the EDSA III riots.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Malacañang Palace"},{"type":"standard","title":"Manila","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Manila</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1461","titles":{"canonical":"Manila","normalized":"Manila","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Manila</span>"},"pageid":184334,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Cityscape_of_Manila%2C_2025_%2801%29.jpg/330px-Cityscape_of_Manila%2C_2025_%2801%29.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Cityscape_of_Manila%2C_2025_%2801%29.jpg","width":3968,"height":2232},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1333913579","tid":"ff2d20a0-f602-11f0-ae77-d5140927dc94","timestamp":"2026-01-20T13:21:58Z","description":"Capital of the Philippines","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":14.5958,"lon":120.9772},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Manila"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Manila","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Manila"}},"extract":"Manila, officially the City of Manila, is the capital and second-most populous city of the Philippines after Quezon City.
