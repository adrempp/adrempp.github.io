President was one of the original six frigates whose construction the Naval Act of 1794 had authorized, and she was the last to be completed. The name \"President\" was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed. Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young Navy's capital ships, and so President and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period. Forman Cheeseman, and later Christian Bergh, were in charge of her construction.
