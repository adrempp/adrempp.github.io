The siege and assault on the city resulted in the near total destruction of the urban area. In 2003, the United Nations designated Grozny as the most destroyed city on Earth. The battle had a devastating impact on the civilian population. It is estimated that between 5,000 and 8,000 civilians were killed during the siege, making it the bloodiest episode of the Second Chechen War.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Battle of Grozny (1999–2000)"},{"type":"standard","title":"Grozny","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Grozny</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q5196","titles":{"canonical":"Grozny","normalized":"Grozny","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Grozny</span>"},"pageid":140790,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8C_%22%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B4%D1%86%D0%B5_%D0%A7%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%B8%22.jpg/330px-%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8C_%22%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B4%D1%86%D0%B5_%D0%A7%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%B8%22.jpg","width":330,"height":186},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8C_%22%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B4%D1%86%D0%B5_%D0%A7%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%B8%22.jpg","width":3000,"height":1688},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1332577239","tid":"d8099b6f-efd7-11f0-b68e-bd46e33e6d69","timestamp":"2026-01-12T16:57:57Z","description":"Capital of Chechnya, Russia","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":43.3125,"lon":45.69861111},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grozny","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grozny?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grozny?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Grozny"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grozny","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Grozny","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grozny?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Grozny"}},"extract":"Grozny is the capital city of Chechnya, Russia.","extract_html":"<p><b>Grozny</b> is the capital city of Chechnya, Russia.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Grozny"},{"type":"standard","title":"Chechnya","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Chechnya</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q5187","titles":{"canonical":"Chechnya","normalized":"Chechnya","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Chechnya</span>"},"pageid":6095,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Flag_of_the_Chechen_Republic.svg/330px-Flag_of_the_Chechen_Republic.svg.png","width":330,"height":220},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Flag_of_the_Chechen_Republic.svg/500px-Flag_of_the_Chechen_Republic.svg.png","width":450,"height":300},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1334761744","tid":"1485c153-f9f8-11f0-92ba-2e4c968a4bd7","timestamp":"2026-01-25T14:13:54Z","description":"Republic of Russia in the North Caucasus","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chechnya"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Chechnya","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chechnya"}},"extract":"Chechnya, officially the Chechen Republic, is a republic of Russia.
