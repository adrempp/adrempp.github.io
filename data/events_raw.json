A subsequent rebellion in Aragon was also suppressed. In the wake of the insurrection, many anarchist activists were imprisoned or deported. The suppression of the insurrection caused a split in the <i>Confederación Nacional del Trabajo</i>, with its radical faction ultimately taking control of the organisation and the moderate faction splitting off to form the Syndicalist Party. Further insurrections were carried out by CNT activists in January and December 1933.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Alt Llobregat insurrection"},{"type":"standard","title":"Catalunya_Central","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Catalunya Central</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1113390","titles":{"canonical":"Catalunya_Central","normalized":"Catalunya Central","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Catalunya Central</span>"},"pageid":22065484,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Montserrat_des_de_Manresa.JPG/330px-Montserrat_des_de_Manresa.JPG","width":320,"height":213},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Montserrat_des_de_Manresa.JPG","width":1000,"height":665},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1256311538","tid":"012f1782-9e75-11ef-821a-3f5816ecd8d7","timestamp":"2024-11-09T08:31:24Z","description":"Vegueria (region) of Catalonia","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":41.77305556,"lon":1.89666667},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalunya_Central","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalunya_Central?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalunya_Central?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Catalunya_Central"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalunya_Central","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Catalunya_Central","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalunya_Central?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Catalunya_Central"}},"extract":"Central Catalonia, also known as Comarques Centrals, is one of the nine regions (vegueries) of Catalonia.","extract_html":"<p><b>Central Catalonia</b>, also known as <i><b>Comarques Centrals</b></i>, is one of the nine regions (<i>vegueries</i>) of Catalonia.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Catalunya Central"},{"type":"standard","title":"Second_Spanish_Republic","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Second Spanish Republic</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q178038","titles":{"canonical":"Second_Spanish_Republic","normalized":"Second Spanish Republic","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Second Spanish Republic</span>"},"pageid":5195347,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Flag_of_Spain_%281931%E2%80%931939%29.svg/330px-Flag_of_Spain_%281931%E2%80%931939%29.svg.png","width":320,"height":192},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Flag_of_Spain_%281931%E2%80%931939%29.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Spain_%281931%E2%80%931939%29.svg.png","width":1000,"height":600},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1333505682","tid":"1fa285c0-f42b-11f0-9af3-9c8f44fa5f94","timestamp":"2026-01-18T05:04:10Z","description":"Government of Spain, 1931–1939","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Second_Spanish_Republic"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Second_Spanish_Republic","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Second_Spanish_Republic"}},"extract":"The Spanish Republic, commonly known as the Second Spanish Republic, was the democratic government of Spain from 1931 to 1939.
