Tanks and aircraft played major roles, enabling the strategic bombing of cities and delivery of the first and only nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II is the deadliest conflict in history, causing the death of over 60 million people. Millions died in genocides, including the Holocaust, and by massacres, starvation, and disease. After the Allied victory, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea were occupied, and German and Japanese leaders were put on trial for war crimes.</p>","normalizedtitle":"World War II"},{"type":"standard","title":"Eighth_Air_Force","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Eighth Air Force</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q270921","titles":{"canonical":"Eighth_Air_Force","normalized":"Eighth Air Force","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Eighth Air Force</span>"},"pageid":464027,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Eighth_Air_Force_-_Emblem.png/330px-Eighth_Air_Force_-_Emblem.png","width":320,"height":310},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Eighth_Air_Force_-_Emblem.png","width":1000,"height":968},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1333354334","tid":"caef01d7-f371-11f0-8c0a-f8e47c75a878","timestamp":"2026-01-17T06:57:31Z","description":"Numbered air force of the United States Air Force","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Air_Force","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Air_Force?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Air_Force?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Eighth_Air_Force"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Air_Force","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Eighth_Air_Force","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Air_Force?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Eighth_Air_Force"}},"extract":"The Eighth Air Force (Air Forces Strategic) is a numbered air force (NAF) of the United States Air Force's Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC).
