In 1783, in the Treaty of Paris, the British monarchy acknowledged the independence of the Thirteen Colonies, leading to the establishment of the United States as an independent and sovereign nation.</p>","normalizedtitle":"American Revolutionary War"},{"type":"standard","title":"Capture_of_Sint_Eustatius","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Capture of Sint Eustatius</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q4188867","titles":{"canonical":"Capture_of_Sint_Eustatius","normalized":"Capture of Sint Eustatius","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Capture of Sint Eustatius</span>"},"pageid":30557052,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/%C3%8Ele_de_Saint_Eustache_en_1781_%28haute_r%C3%A9solution%29.jpg/330px-%C3%8Ele_de_Saint_Eustache_en_1781_%28haute_r%C3%A9solution%29.jpg","width":330,"height":238},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/%C3%8Ele_de_Saint_Eustache_en_1781_%28haute_r%C3%A9solution%29.jpg","width":4000,"height":2880},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1332281609","tid":"8e0e9e99-ee81-11f0-8a7d-35564883693b","timestamp":"2026-01-11T00:07:45Z","description":"Part of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1781)","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":17.48333333,"lon":-62.98333333},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Sint_Eustatius","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Sint_Eustatius?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Sint_Eustatius?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Capture_of_Sint_Eustatius"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Sint_Eustatius","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Capture_of_Sint_Eustatius","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Sint_Eustatius?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Capture_of_Sint_Eustatius"}},"extract":"The British Capture of Sint Eustatius took place in February 1781 during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War when British Army and naval forces under Lieutenant-General Sir John Vaughan and Admiral George Rodney seized the Dutch-owned Caribbean island of Sint Eustatius.
