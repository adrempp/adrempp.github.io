The world price of oil had peaked in 1980 at over US$35 per barrel ; it fell in 1986 from $27 to below $10. The glut began in the early 1980s as a result of slowed economic activity in industrial countries due to the crises of the 1970s, especially in 1973 and 1979, and the energy conservation spurred by high fuel prices. The inflation-adjusted real 2004 dollar value of oil fell from an average of $78.2 in 1981 to an average of $26.8 per barrel in 1986.</p>","normalizedtitle":"1980s oil glut"}],"year":1981},{"text":"USCGC Blackthorn collides with the tanker Capricorn while leaving Tampa, Florida and capsizes, killing 23 Coast Guard crewmembers.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"USCGC_Blackthorn","displaytitle":"USCGC <i>Blackthorn</i>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q7866014","titles":{"canonical":"USCGC_Blackthorn","normalized":"USCGC Blackthorn","display":"USCGC <i>Blackthorn</i>"},"pageid":3976223,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/USCGC_Blackthorn_%28WLB-391%29_underway_in_1972.jpg/330px-USCGC_Blackthorn_%28WLB-391%29_underway_in_1972.jpg","width":330,"height":248},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/USCGC_Blackthorn_%28WLB-391%29_underway_in_1972.jpg","width":901,"height":676},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1326928978","tid":"122509e0-d6bf-11f0-b1a9-bf673eac91dd","timestamp":"2025-12-11T18:27:38Z","description":"United States Coast Guard ship, sank 1980","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Blackthorn","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Blackthorn?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Blackthorn?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:USCGC_Blackthorn"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Blackthorn","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/USCGC_Blackthorn","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Blackthorn?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:USCGC_Blackthorn"}},"extract":"USCGC Blackthorn (WLB-391) was a 180-foot (55 m) seagoing buoy tender (WLB) which sank in 1980 in a collision near the Tampa Bay Sunshine Skyway Bridge, resulting in 23 crew member fatalities. \nAn Iris-class vessel, she was built by Marine Ironworks and Shipbuilding Corporation in Duluth, Minnesota.
