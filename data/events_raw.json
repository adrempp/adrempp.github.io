He quickly rose to a place of prominence and became one of its most popular speakers. In an attempt to more broadly appeal to larger segments of the population and win over German workers, the party name was changed to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, commonly known as the Nazi Party, and a new platform was adopted. Hitler was made the party leader in 1921 after he threatened to otherwise leave. By 1922, his control over the party was unchallenged. The Nazis were a right-wing party, but in the early years they also had anti-bourgeois elements. Hitler later initiated a purge of these elements and reaffirmed the Nazi Party's support for collaboration with German businesses.

He quickly rose to a place of prominence and became one of its most popular speakers. In an attempt to more broadly appeal to larger segments of the population and win over German workers, the party name was changed to the <i>Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei</i>, commonly known as the Nazi Party, and a new platform was adopted. Hitler was made the party leader in 1921 after he threatened to otherwise leave. By 1922, his control over the party was unchallenged. The Nazis were a right-wing party, but in the early years they also had anti-bourgeois elements.

Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers of cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement. Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled, such as drones.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Airplane"},{"type":"standard","title":"John_Alexander_Douglas_McCurdy","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">John Alexander Douglas McCurdy</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1699115","titles":{"canonical":"John_Alexander_Douglas_McCurdy","normalized":"John Alexander Douglas McCurdy","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">John Alexander Douglas McCurdy</span>"},"pageid":2386759,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/John_A.D._McCurdy.jpg","width":243,"height":255},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/John_A.D._McCurdy.jpg","width":243,"height":255},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1304713559","tid":"c20a03ad-73bb-11f0-81ee-9b6f0cb73944","timestamp":"2025-08-07T18:24:30Z","description":"20th-century Canadian aviator; Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia (1947–52)","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Alexander_Douglas_McCurdy","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Alexander_Douglas_McCurdy?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Alexander_Douglas_McCurdy?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:John_Alexander_Douglas_McCurdy"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Alexander_Douglas_McCurdy","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/John_Alexander_Douglas_McCurdy","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Alexander_Douglas_McCurdy?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:John_Alexander_Douglas_McCurdy"}},"extract":"John Alexander Douglas McCurdy, was a Canadian aviation pioneer and the 20th Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia from 1947 to 1952.","extract_html":"<p><b>John Alexander Douglas McCurdy</b>, was a Canadian aviation pioneer and the 20th Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia from 1947 to 1952.</p>","normalizedtitle":"John Alexander Douglas McCurdy"},{"type":"standard","title":"Havana","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Havana</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1563","titles":{"canonical":"Havana","normalized":"Havana","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Havana</span>"},"pageid":49719,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/DJI_0197_crp_wiki.jpg/330px-DJI_0197_crp_wiki.jpg","width":330,"height":186},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/DJI_0197_crp_wiki.jpg","width":1920,"height":1080},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1335030971","tid":"7d615b33-fb12-11f0-944c-997b367f4555","timestamp":"2026-01-26T23:55:28Z","description":"Capital and largest city of Cuba","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":23.13666667,"lon":-82.35888889},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Havana"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Havana","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Havana"}},"extract":"Havana is the capital and largest city of Cuba.
