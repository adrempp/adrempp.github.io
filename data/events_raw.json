Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople. The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as Oxbridge.</p>","normalizedtitle":"University of Cambridge"},{"type":"standard","title":"Integral","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Integral</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q80091","titles":{"canonical":"Integral","normalized":"Integral","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Integral</span>"},"pageid":15532,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Integral_example.svg/330px-Integral_example.svg.png","width":320,"height":320},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Integral_example.svg/500px-Integral_example.svg.png","width":420,"height":420},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1333129421","tid":"ec12fcf6-f25e-11f0-8cc8-770edca85490","timestamp":"2026-01-15T22:09:55Z","description":"Operation in mathematical calculus","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Integral"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Integral","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Integral"}},"extract":"In mathematics, an integral is the continuous analog of a sum, and is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations.
